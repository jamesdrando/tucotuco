# NOW.md — Agent Handoff Log

> **Protocol:** Every agent session reads this file first and writes to it last.
> - Move "NEXT" → "JUST DONE" before starting work.
> - Write the new "NEXT" based on the first unblocked task in TASKS.md.
> - Reference SPEC.md sections and TASKS.md IDs explicitly.
> - Keep entries concise and factual — this is a baton, not a diary.

## CURRENT STATE

**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Phase:** Phase 1 — Core Engine (In-Memory, SQL-92 Subset)
**Milestone in progress:** M1

---

## JUST DONE

Completed `TASKS.md` T-062 and T-063 using `SPEC.md` §7, §8, and §11, building on the current analyzer resolver/type-checker state.

- Extended `internal/analyzer/typecheck.go` to invoke a dedicated post-typecheck aggregate-placement pass and to enforce remaining write-time checks for `CREATE TABLE` defaults.
- Added `internal/analyzer/writecheck.go` and `internal/analyzer/writecheck_test.go` to validate `INSERT` row/query column counts, `UPDATE` tuple assignment shape, omitted required columns, `DEFAULT VALUES`, explicit `NULL` writes to `NOT NULL` targets, and `NOT NULL DEFAULT NULL`.
- Added `internal/analyzer/aggregate_validation.go` and `internal/analyzer/aggregate_validation_test.go` to validate aggregate placement across the current Phase 1 CST surface, reject nested aggregates, recurse through derived tables/subqueries, and enforce grouped-query column usage without mutating parser nodes or resolver/type side tables.
- Updated the existing analyzer tests that exercised aggregate typing so they still cover type assignment on semantically valid grouped queries under the new placement rules.
- Verified `env GOCACHE=/tmp/tucotuco-go-build go test ./internal/analyzer`.
- Attempted targeted lint, but no `golangci-lint` binary was available in the workspace (`./.bin/golangci-lint` missing and none on `PATH`).
- Marked `TASKS.md` T-062 and T-063 complete after targeted package tests passed.

## NEXT

**Task(s) to execute:** T-080

**Instructions for the incoming agent:**

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `INDEX.md` again before starting Phase 1 work.
2. Start **T-080** in `internal/planner/`, using the now-validated analyzer output as the semantic boundary rather than adding more parser/analyzer features first.
3. Keep the first planner slice narrow: define the logical plan node interface plus the basic `Scan`, `Filter`, `Project`, and `Limit` nodes required by `TASKS.md`.
4. Read the planner-related `INDEX.md` interface map before coding and keep the new planner types aligned with the existing package layout and naming style.
5. Add focused planner tests for node construction / formatting contracts as the first acceptance layer before attempting plan-builder work in `T-081`.
6. Run targeted validation for the planner package; if lint is required, first restore or install a `golangci-lint` binary because none was available during the analyzer closeout.
7. Update `TASKS.md`, `NOW.md`, and `SPEC.md` if later design decisions diverge from the current spec text.

**Spec references:** `SPEC.md` §7, §8

**Estimated parallelism available:** 1 stream (`T-080`)
